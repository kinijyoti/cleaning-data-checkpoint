    "Make note of your answers to the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Did you find all four types of dirty data in your dataset?\n",
    "    I don't find any  issing data in the dataset. \n",
    "2. Did the process of cleaning your data give you new insights into your dataset?\n",
    "   Yes, removing the duplicate values in the datset gives the new insights in the datset.\n",
    "3. Is there anything you would like to make note of when it comes to manipulating the data and making visualizations?\n",
    "   This visualization reveals several key insights about salary differences across work settings\n",
    "\n",
    "Salary Ranges: Remote work settings display the widest range of salaries, indicating greater variability in compensation for remote positions. In-person work settings show a more compact salary range, suggesting more standardized pay scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers: All three work settings have salary outliers on the higher end, but remote work seems to have the most extreme high-end outliers. This could indicate that some remote positions, possibly for highly specialized or senior roles, command exceptionally high salaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower Quartiles: The lower quartile for hybrid work is noticeably lower than for in-person or remote work, suggesting that entry-level or lower-paying positions are more common in hybrid settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upper Quartiles: The upper quartile for in-person work is slightly higher than for remote work, indicating that high-paying in-person roles might offer somewhat better compensation than their remote counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "These observations suggest that while in-person work tends to offer slightly higher median salaries, remote work provides the potential for the highest-paying positions. Hybrid work, interestingly, shows lower overall salaries compared to the other two options. This could be due to various factors such as industry trends, company policies, or the types of roles typically offered in each setting."
